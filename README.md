# Editor Tools

Here are the tools I have created throughout my work process:

## 1. RoadMaker

This tool helps to create interconnected cubes based on the user's click location.

## 2. JsonUtility

This tool supports the conversion and usage of the JSON format.

## 3. BetterTransformInspector

This script customizes the Transform Inspector, adding buttons to quickly reset Position (0,0,0), Rotation (0,0,0), and Scale (1,1,1).
